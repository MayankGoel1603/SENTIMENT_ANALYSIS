# SENTIMENT_ANALYSIS
# Sentiment Analysis and Opinion Mining of Fitbit User Reviews 
A comprehensive analysis of over 330,000 customer reviews to extract actionable business intelligence and perform a competitive market analysis using NLP and Topic Modeling.
# Project Overview
In the competitive wearable technology market, customer feedback is a goldmine of strategic information. This project performs a deep-dive analysis of over 330,000 Fitbit user reviews to extract the core drivers of customer sentiment. By systematically processing and modeling unstructured text, this analysis moves beyond simple star ratings to answer critical business questions:
What are the most significant issues causing customer dissatisfaction?
What are the most beloved features that create brand loyalty?
Who are our main competitors, and why are users considering them?

The project is structured into three main analytical notebooks, each tackling one of these core questions.
# Key Objectives
Identify Common Issues: Analyze negative reviews (1-2 stars) to pinpoint the most frequent product failures and user frustrations.
Identify Brand Strengths: Analyze positive reviews (4-5 stars) to understand the key features and experiences that drive brand loyalty.
Analyze the Competitive Landscape: Quantify competitor mentions and analyze the context to understand churn risk and market positioning.

# Dataset
The analysis is based on a public dataset of 333,491 Fitbit user reviews. The cleaned dataset FitBitReviews_updated.csv is the primary file used across all notebooks. The key columns utilized are review_description and rating.

# Analytical Pipeline
This project follows a structured NLP pipeline to ensure robust and repeatable results:
## Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:
Loaded and filtered the dataset using pandas.
Cleaned review text by converting to lowercase and using regex to remove non-alphanumeric characters.
Removed common English and domain-specific stop words (e.g., "fitbit", "app") using NLTK.
## Feature Engineering & Topic Modeling:
Converted cleaned text into a numerical format using TfidfVectorizer from scikit-learn.
Applied Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to the TF-IDF matrix to identify the top 5 latent topics for both negative and positive reviews.
## Competitive Analysis:
Implemented a keyword matching algorithm to scan all reviews for mentions of key competitors (e.g., Apple Watch, Garmin, Samsung).
Quantified the frequency of mentions and analyzed the average star rating of the reviews to understand the sentiment context.
## Insight Verification:
The keyword clusters generated by NMF were interpreted and then verified using the google/flan-t5-large model via the Hugging Face Transformers library to ensure the accuracy of the manual interpretations.

# Key Findings & Insights
## Top Customer Issues 
#### 1- Syncing & Connectivity Failure: The #1 issue. Users are immensely frustrated with the inability of their devices to sync reliably with their phones.
#### 2- Unreliable Software Updates: Updates are perceived as a major risk, often cited as the direct cause of a device "breaking" or losing functionality.
#### 3- Device & Battery Failure: A significant volume of complaints centered on devices that stopped working or wouldn't hold a charge.
## Core Brand Strengths (The "Keep-List")
#### 1- Powerful Motivation: The product's ability to motivate users through goal tracking and reminders is its most powerful and beloved feature.
#### 2- Excellent Sleep Tracking: The sleep tracking feature is universally praised for its detail and insights.
#### 3- Ease of Use: A significant user segment values the product for being easy to set up and understand.
## Competitive Threats
#### Garmin, Apple Watch, and Samsung are the most frequently mentioned competitors.
#### These brands are almost exclusively mentioned in highly negative reviews (average rating < 2.2 stars), indicating they are seen as direct replacements by customers at high risk of churning.
